<h2>President Maria Theresa Von Walburg
</h2>
<p>Greetings. I am Maria Theresa, a student currently studying International Relations, History and Anthropology, and Post-Communist Politics. I have been given the honor of being the representative of the Habsburg Sorority. Together, we can make the world a better, peaceful place.</p>

<h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
<p>Interestingly, with all its preachings of peace and cooperation, The Habsburg Foundation was founded because of the first World War. It began as a gathering of a small band of army nurses who saw firsthand the evil that people could inflict on one another. Despite their humble backgrounds, these nurses sought to change the world.</p>

<h2>The Ties That Bind</h2>
<p>The goal was never to change the world they were already living in. No, their generation was a lost cause. Instead, the nurses sought to ensure that their children, and their childrenâ€™s children, would not make the same mistakes that their forefathers had made. And so, the Foundation quickly became a fixture in schools, libraries, and public forums. The Habsburg Sorority is one such fixture.</p>
