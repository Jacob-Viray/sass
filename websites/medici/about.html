<h2>Director Cosimo Di Giovanni
</h2>
<p>Greetings. I am Cosimo Di Giovanni, an honor student and also the President of the Business Leaders Club, Founder of the Student Economists Initiative, and Board Member of the SAIT-SCA Student Advisory. Like myself, many of our student members are already active leaders in the community and beyond. If you have the passion, we would be more than happy to guide you in your growth.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Cosimo Group was founded in 1980 at a busy street corner by Wall Street and Main. Founded by two bright young businessmen, the organization quickly grew to become the biggest network of professionals and innovators in the world. Twenty years later, the organization expanded into universities where it became wildly popular with 30 different chapters sprouting up worldwide in less than a year.</p>
