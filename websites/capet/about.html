<h2>President Louis Le Jeune
</h2>
<p>Salut! Welcome to the home of the Capetians. I am Louis Le Jeune the Seventh, of the House of Capet. That’s right! I am directly descended from the founding members of this great fraternity. With your help, I will aim to maintain the high standards that the esteemed leaders of the past have strived to uphold.</p>

<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>The Capet Fraternity was founded in 1804 not long after the French Revolution. It originally began as an ‘invite-only’ salon in Paris where mostly young men of noble birth were taught how to navigate upper society. It continued to be so for almost a century until the Capet family eventually transformed the salon into an official private school for the wealthy.</p>

<h2>Transformation</h2>
<p>The school itself did not survive the ravages of the second World War. Instead of rebuilding it again, the Capet family decided to integrate what remained of the school with Sorbonne University. Louis-Auguste the Fifth, a student at the time, sought to maintain the original teachings and principles of the Capet school. He then established what would be the first chapter of the Capet Fraternity in Paris.</p>
