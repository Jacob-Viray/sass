<h2>Grandmaster Richard de Coeur
</h2>
<p>Welcome, Brother! I am Richard de Coeur, engineering student and star quarterback of the SAIT Lionhearts. I have been the proud leader of the Plantagenet Society since my first year. Since that time, the Society’s membership has grown to include a wide diversity of students in terms of their educational background, aspirations, and goals. You are more than welcome to join us!

<h2>In The Beginning</h2>
<p>The Plantagenet Society traces its origins right at the founding of SAIT. At the time of the school’s establishment, two prominent fraternities popped up: the Lancaster Fraternity and the York Brotherhood. Rivalry between the two organizations was fierce. Everything, from academia to the sports fields, was a battlefield.

<h2>What Came Next</h2>
<p>Things eventually came to a head when it was decreed that the school could only have one football team. At the time, the school was sporting two: the Royals and the Nobles. Of course, each of the two fraternities supported differing teams. It was only after the efforts of legendary coach William Kingmaker that not only did both teams unite, but the two fraternities also became one.
