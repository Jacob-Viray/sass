<h2>History</h2>
<p>It is difficult to pinpoint the exact time that the Ayyubid Guild was founded. Most historians however agree that the Guild can trace its roots back to the 1100’s. It started off as a monthly gathering of imams and scholars on the banks of Tripoli where they would converse and debate one another on various aspects of life and what comes after it.</p>

<h2>Scholarships</h2>
<p>The Guild issues $500,000 worth of scholarship grants every year by way of the Antiochian Fund set up more than 50 years ago by the late Raymond Joscelyn, one of the Guild’s most prominent members. The scholarship applies only to existing members and incoming applicants that have already been pre-approved.</p>
