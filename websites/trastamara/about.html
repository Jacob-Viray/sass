<h2>President Isabelle de la Asturias
</h2>
<p>Muy Buenos. Please call me Isabelle. Thank you for your interest in our organization. As the elected Trastamaran leader, I am here to help members find out what they really want during this wild ride that we call higher learning. We are young and we are still not sure of our place in life. But together, we might just be able to take a step or two closer towards finding that out.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Trastamara Sisterhood is a relatively new sorority that started at the west coast of North America and has slowly been inching its way through the central provinces and states. It was formed after two West Coast sororities, the Castilian Order and the Leon Sorority, were disbanded when their parent campuses shut down.

<h2>Affiliations</h2>
<p>The sorority has a brother-fraternity newly established in Vancouver’s campuses. It has also recently established ties with the Plantagenet Society as part of an effort to assist female students in joining the Greek organizations. Lastly, the organization has strong ties to Calgary’s Female Workers Council, a nonprofit initiative aimed at empowering women.
